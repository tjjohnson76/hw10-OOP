# Unit 10: Object Oriented Programming - SVG logo maker

In this assignment, I created a javascript file which would write new svg files of logos based on a users input. The user would input 3 characters or less, the color of the text, a choice of 3 shapes, and the color of the shape into the terminal. Then, the javascript file would create a corresponding shape object through the shape class. This new shape object would be able to call a method called "render()" which would give back a string literal which would be used to write a new svg file.

(side note: I had forgotten to initialize the git repository till I had finished coding. There will not be more than a few commits to this repository because of this.)
